      "answer": "By the end of *Pride and Prejudice*, Elizabeth Bennet marries Fitzwilliam Darcy. This decision is reached through a series of events and realizations that take place throughout the novel.\n\nInitially, Elizabeth is prejudiced against Darcy due to his perceived pride and haughty reserve. However, as she gets to know him better, particularly through his letter explaining his actions towards George Wickham and his proposal to her at Hunsford, she begins to see him in a different light.\n\nMeanwhile, Darcy's admiration for Elizabeth only grows stronger, and he becomes more humble and self-aware, recognizing his own flaws and mistakes. After he helps Lydia and Wickham get married, Elizabeth is touched by his kindness and begins to feel grateful towards him.\n\nThe turning point comes when Darcy proposes to Elizabeth for the second time, and this time, he does so with a more humble and sincere attitude. Elizabeth, having come to realize her own biases and misconceptions, accepts his proposal, and they get engaged.\n\nThroughout the novel, Austen explores the themes of love, class, and social status, ultimately showing that true love can conquer even the most stubborn of prejudices, and that a marriage based on mutual respect, understanding, and affection is the most desirable outcome."
