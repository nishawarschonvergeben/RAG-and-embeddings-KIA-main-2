      "rewritten_query": "How does Elisabeth feel about Darcy?",
      "answer": "Based on the provided context, we can infer that Elizabeth feels no romantic interest in Darcy whatsoever. The passage indicates that Lady Catherine tries to provoke Darcy into disliking Elizabeth, which suggests that Elizabeth herself doesn't show any inclination towards him. In fact, Georgiana is astonished by Elizabeth's lively and sportive manner of talking to her brother, indicating that Elizabeth treats Darcy with the same casual, non-romantic attitude she would display towards anyone else. This is further supported by the fact that Lady Catherine's attempts to get rid of Elizabeth by talking about their supposed marriage have no apparent effect on Elizabeth herself."

      "answer": "Based on the context, it is not explicitly stated what Elizabeth's first impression of Mr. Darcy is. However, from the passage, we can infer that her initial impression was not favorable. \n\nIn the first paragraph, Mr. Darcy is described as being exposed to the civility of Mr. Bennet, implying that Mr. Darcy is not comfortable with the excessive politeness shown to him. This suggests that Elizabeth might have initially found him prideful or haughty. \n\nMoreover, in the second paragraph, it is mentioned that Elizabeth had undergone a \"gradual change\" in her estimation of Mr. Darcy, indicating that her initial opinion was likely negative. Additionally, there is a mention of his \"good qualities\" being enumerated, implying that these were not apparent to her at first."
