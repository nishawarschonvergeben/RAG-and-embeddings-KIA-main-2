      "answer": "Based on the given context, it doesn't explicitly state how Elizabeth feels about Darcy. However, we can infer that Elizabeth is not attempting to win Darcy's affections, nor is she showing signs of romantic interest in him. In fact, she seems to be treating him with a playful, sportive manner, which astonishes Georgiana. This suggest that Elizabeth views Darcy more as a acquaintance or a friend's brother, rather than a potential suitor."

      "answer": "According to the passage, Elizabeth \"knew that she was happy\" rather than \"felt herself to be so\".

However, she is also playful and teasing towards Darcy, asking him how he fell in love with her, which implies a growing affection and comfort with him."
