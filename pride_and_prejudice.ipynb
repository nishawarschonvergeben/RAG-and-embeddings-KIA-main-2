      "Elizabeth reacts to the letter with a mix of emotions. Initially, she is amazed that Darcy believes he has an apology to make, and she is persuaded that he has no explanation that would not be concealed by shame. She reads the letter with eagerness, impatience, and strong prejudice against what Darcy might say. As she reads, her feelings change, and she experiences contrariety (opposite emotions). At times, she feels indignation, but then her anger turns against herself, and she develops compassion for Darcy's disappointed feelings.
